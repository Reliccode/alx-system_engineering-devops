**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident**

Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start Time: 2023-12-07 15:30 EAT
End Time: 2023-12-07 18:45 EAT

Impact:
The user-facing authentication service experienced a complete outage.
Users were unable to log in, resulting in a 30% degradation in user experience.
  
Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to a disruption in the traffic flow to the authentication service.

Timeline:
15:30 EAT: Issue Detected
An increase in error rates for authentication service was flagged by our monitoring system.

15:35 EAT: Actions Taken
The operations team started investigating the issue, assuming it might be related to database connectivity or a recent deployment.

16:00 EAT: Misleading Paths
Initial investigation focused on recent code deployments and database connectivity issues, leading to a delay in identifying the misconfiguration in the load balancer.

17:15 EAT: Escalation
The incident was escalated to the network infrastructure team as suspicions arose regarding potential networking issues.

18:00 EAT: Corrective Actions
After identifying the misconfiguration in the load balancer, traffic was rerouted correctly, and the authentication service started recovering.

18:45 EAT: Issue Resolved
Full service recovery confirmed. Users could successfully log in again.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
The load balancer was misconfigured to route traffic to an incorrect set of servers, leading to the authentication service being effectively isolated from the user traffic.

Resolution:
Load balancer settings were corrected to ensure the proper distribution of traffic among the authentication servers.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes
Enhance monitoring for load balancer configurations and traffic patterns.

Implement automated testing for load balancer configurations during the deployment process.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations to identify and rectify potential issues.
Establish better communication channels between the operations and network infrastructure teams to expedite issue resolution.
Schedule regular training sessions for the operations team to enhance troubleshooting skills and familiarity with the entire web stack.
Develop and document a standardized procedure for load balancer configuration changes to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.

Conclusion
The outage was a result of a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, which was not promptly identified due to initial assumptions about potential database or deployment issues. Improved monitoring, automated testing, and enhanced collaboration between teams are essential steps to prevent similar incidents in the future. The corrective measures outlined aim to address the specific issues identified and fortify the system against similar vulnerabilities, ensuring a more resilient and reliable web stack.
